To create agents we use the new model API responses from OpenAI with the version openai-agents==0.0.13 and openai==1.76.0
we use a modular backend version 
We provide agents with long-term memory to enable context-aware conversations
We separate the db logic in a db.py file
we use the DB postgresql
to create migrations we use un toml file with a Startcommandstart
we create a gitignore file
we create a readme file
the backend will be python + fastapi
we use postgresql for the database
the code produce should be ready for local testing and for production deployment in production
Backend must read the port from variables environment
we use a Procfile for the web server
